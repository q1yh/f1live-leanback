# f1live-leanback
It is an experimental F1 Racing match room app for Android TV. It is designed to occupy some hours of my Android TV during match days, from which I could enjoy the amazing racing match, offical videos, etc. Ff the match was boring, It could also find some noisy but funny tweets from crazy fans for you. 

In aspect of code, it is derived from previous project cantv-leanback, and I extract the twitterwall module independently so it is easily to be merged into your own codes.
