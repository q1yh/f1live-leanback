# f1live-leanback
Hi, f1live is an experimental F1 Race watching app for Android TV. It is initially designed to satisfy my requirement of better F1 Race watching experience in my Android TV during match days. Now I could enjoy the amazing racing match, offical videos, etc. If the match was boring, It could also help you to find out some noisy but funny tweets from crazy fans all around the world in real-time. 

Talk about the code, the APP is partially referenced by my previous project [Cantv-leanback](https://github.com/q1yh/cantv-leanback/), and I developped [Twitterwall](https://github.com/q1yh/twitterwall/), a general tweets data collection and render into a stagged grid view, which was publish independently so it could be merged into your own codes easily.
