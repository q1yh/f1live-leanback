## Code

This APP is partially referenced by my previous project [Cantv-leanback](https://github.com/q1yh/cantv-leanback/), and plus I developped [Twitterwall](https://github.com/q1yh/twitterwall/), a general tweets data collection and stagged grid view render, which was publish independently so it could be merged into any other project easily.
